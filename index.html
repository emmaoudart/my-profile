			<h2> TRAVELLING</h2>
	      	<p>

	    		I love to discover new countries and new people. My dream is to travel all around the world to meet people and to understand better their culture.
	    		For example, next semester, I planned to go to Finland for my exchange. It's a country that I don't know at all and I can't wait to discover it.

	    	<h2> DANCE </h2>

	    	<p>

	    		I am passionate about dance, it's one of my favorite sport. I practice dance since I was 5 and I feel so free when I practice it.
	    		In my opinion, it's one of the most beautiful art because the only thing you need to express yourself is your body and some music. 
	    		I tried a lot of different types of dance and I totally love the diversity that you can find in this sport.

	    	<h2> BADMINTON</h2>

	    	<p>

	    		I am passionate about badminton. Such as dance, I've been practicing this sport for a long time. I started when I was 10 and I only stopped because of coronavirus. I played against adults during two years and it was one of the best experience of my life. I didn't have the same level as them so I had to work a lot to improve myself and I really enjoyed it.
